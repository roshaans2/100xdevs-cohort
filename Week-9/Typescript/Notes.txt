Strongly typed languages and loosely typed languages - refers to how programming languages handle types and particularly how strict 
they are about the type conversion and type safety

Strongly typed languages - Java, C++, Rust. Lesser runtime errors, easy to catch errors at compile time. 
loosely typed languages - Python, php, perl. Easy to write code

What is typescript?
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

Where/How does typescript code run?
Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript. 
Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)
Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript
When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking (similar to C++). If there is an error, the conversion to Javascript fails. 

Typescript compiler
tsc is the official typescript compiler that you can use to convert Typescript code into Javascript
There are many other famous compilers/transpilers for converting Typescript to Javascript. Some famous ones are - 
esbuild
swc

What are interfaces? 
To assign types to object you use interfaces

What are types?
Very similar to interfaces , types let you aggregate data together. But it provides unique features like union and intersect. Check types.ts file for
example
