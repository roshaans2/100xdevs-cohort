What are Middlewares?

Middlewares are for precheck.
Two types of precheck occur in real world. They are authentication and input validation
It actually the logic that occurs between request and response

Only if next() is specified, control will reach to main logic

app.use() must be put only at the top, then only next() will go correctly. It can find the next logic to implement

We can put app.use() at end if we need to handle exceptions

Global catches help you to give user a better error message
It has four arguments err,req,res,next


Zod is an independent library that validates user input


Authentication - 

A request is made from browser. Once credentials are validated, the server returns a token
Client stores the token in local Storage
For every subsequent request you send this token along with request
Now server doesn't take username and password, it just check the token and return resources


Hashing - Hashing is one way. You can only convert string to a hash. You cannot convert hash back to a string

Encryption - Encryption is two way. You can convert a string to a hash (Cipher text) using a key and revert back original string using the same key.


Json Web Tokens - 

It takes JSON as an input
It is used on the Web
It gives token as the output

Anyone who has token can see the input Json

          Password
            |
input ->  hashing      -> Token
          (Encoding)


            Password
              |
Token -> (Verification)-> input
       


Whenever user logins with username and password, the backend Server checks the database and after verifying returns a jwt token
This token is stored in Client's localstorage and send along with subsequent request
For subsequent request, the backend server just verifies token and response
