What are Middlewares?

Middlewares are for precheck.
Two types of precheck occur in real world. They are authentication and input validation
It actually the logic that occurs between request and response

Only if next() is specified, control will reach to main logic

app.use() must be put only at the top, then only next() will go correctly. It can find the next logic to implement

We can put app.use() at end if we need to handle exceptions

Global catches help you to give user a better error message
It has four arguments err,req,res,next
